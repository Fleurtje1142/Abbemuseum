                I like this because it is a very powerfull piece of art because the art is about the Dutch black feminist movement.
                The artists was born in the Netherlands but is a descendant from Surinamese parents. Her art is a lot about discovering and investigating her Surinamese background.
                In her art she also tries to raise question about African Diaspora’s movements and it’s relation to feminism, sexuality, racism and the history of slavery.
