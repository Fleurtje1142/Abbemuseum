                I like this work because it is about the Aboriginals. My niece lived in Austalia for about 5 years and told me a lot about the Aboriginals.
                I found it very intresting to learn about how the artwork is made because it is made from wood that came from old houses where they lived.
                The Aboriginals lived in these houses in the city on holy ground but when the city wanted to build houses on that ground they where chased away. 
                The land wasn't officially form the Aboriginals so they could be sent away.
