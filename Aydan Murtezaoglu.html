                I love this artwork because it is simple. It is just a picture of a girl sitting on a bench looking over the water and to the city. 
                I also think it is really funny to see that see that the city is crooked. 
                And then the dog just sleeping behind the bench like nothing is going on. I also wonder what city it is. 
                I am also curious on how the arist made the picture because it looks really cool.
