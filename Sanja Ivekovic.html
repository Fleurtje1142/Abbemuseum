                I like this work because it is a pretty picture but the message behind it is real. It is also a thing that people forget. 
                Because the text underneed the picture is about a women that is is arrested for protesting. She was sent to auschwitz but she survived.
                The artist herself is the daughter of the women whos name is under the photo. It is her mothers story. This is one photo in a series of six photos.
                The other five photos are also of models with names under it of women who died in world war two for protesting for women.
                Those women where some of the women who stood up for women and got tortured and killed for it.
